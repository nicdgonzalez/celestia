# Building a Minecraft Dashboard from Scratch

ðŸ“… 2025-09-20 (Day 3)

## TLDR

Today we:

- Implemented the Server List Ping protocol for `GET /api/server/status` to
  persist the Minecraft server's status across refreshes, and
- Started designing the dashboard.

Next time, I want to:

- Continue with the Dashboard UI, and
- Implement the start and stop endpoints.

## Planning

An outline of what we want to make, and what we have to do next to get there.

### Features

- [ ] Start/Stop the server from the dashboard.
- [ ] Display whether the server is currently online or offline.
- [ ] Display who is currently online, and how long they have been playing for.
- [ ] Display resource usage percentages.
- [ ] Update server properties.
- [ ] Manage plugins.
- [ ] Read/Write directly to the server console.

### TODO

- [x] Display proper initial values when opening up the UI.
- [ ] Make the Dashboard prettier.
- [ ] Proper specification/documentation for the Rust API.
- [ ] Come up with a way to link the Minecraft server to the Dashboard.
